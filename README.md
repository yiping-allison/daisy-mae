# Isabelle

## Animal Crossing New Horizons Discord Bot

**Isabelle** is an Animal Crossing: New Horizons discord bot made with [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo). The goal is to make community and game interactions for a discord server easier! (It's also a good way for me to practice Go ;) )

**NOTE:** I am not planning on making Isabelle into a moderation bot as there are a lot of good ones existing
at the moment! Thanks!

I will not be providing a server for this bot. If you would like to use Isabelle, please check out the documentation
in the [wiki](https://github.com/yiping-allison/isabelle/wiki).

## Detailed Documentation and Guides

**Isabelle** has her own [wiki page](https://github.com/yiping-allison/isabelle/wiki) where I included setup instructions and command documentation.

Please read the wiki before asking me any questions, thanks!

**Please NOTE:** The bot is still under development so files are continually changing; Current files are subject to change.
